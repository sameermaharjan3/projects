<!--It took me about an hour to complete this lab.This lab helped me to understand javascript to some extent.
I've not worked with Javascript but I came to know that it is not much different in terms of programming.
Some noticeable differences that I noticed are using triple equals while using comparision,
not having variable types, etc. and I am sure there will be more as I explore more.-->
