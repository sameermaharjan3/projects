<!--STATUS REPORT
It took me about one hour to complete this lab.
Before beginning the lab, I had to go through the slides and syntax of jQuery again.
The most interesting thing that I found out in this lab was the difference between
mouseleave and mouseout. I used mouseout at the beginning make the user lose the game
if the mouse pointer goes outside of the maze but it did't work as mouseout applies in
the child divs. So, I used mouseleave to solve this problem.-->
