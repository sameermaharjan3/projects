<!--It took me about two and half hours to complete this assignment. I completed number 1 and 2 as I am not familiar with
JSHint/ESLint. Regarding the assignment, it took me a while to get the concept of DOM, and how to use event handlers.
I solved all the problems smoothly except one, where I had to use parseInt to set the font size of the text. At the
beginning I tried to do it by following the same method in the class, using the parseInt method, and
adding it to a constant followed by the string 'pt'. But, it didn't work;it was giving NaN value.
So, I tried few other methods and finally came up with a solution. I had to use getPropertyValue
of window to get the font size and then increase it by 2.-->
