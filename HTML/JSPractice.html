<!--STATUS REPORT
It took me about two hours to complete. I learnt few things through this lab.
Firstly, I got the concept how the objects work in javascript. One thing that
amazed me was the function that can be assigned as value of a property.
Similarly, the new thing that I learned is the key property of the object. I
used this property to solve the last problem, which took most of my time to
complete this lab.-->
